    <h1>Reading Response B (Vacuuming and Digesting)</h1>

<p>Nilas Andersen: To me it fits within the category of schools that have a little bit of anti-establishment aesthetic. Coming from Europe and looking at the Yale website, it looks very different, but also it looks European. It’s completely different from any other American school. I think you see more of things like this in Europe, but not necessarily because they came before. They may have come after this.</p>

<p>Ayham: I wonder if you could talk about the anti-establishment aesthetic. What are all the identities rolled into that? It’s something very unique to making work on the web—that the identity isn’t necessarily just a logo but there’s specific ways of working that can communicate these ideas. </p>

<p>Dan: This site is a good example for how, just like you guys have been expressing, an identity of an institution can emerge not just through logo or visual form, but through user experience and the way in which the site evolves over time. It can have a relationship with other schools or maybe influence other schools or be influenced by them as a system.</p>

<p> Evan: I remember the first time seeing the Yale School of Art website and hating it. I remember how I really didnt understand it. Because of that, it forced me to interact with it more. I found myself spending a lot of time clicking all around because every page was different and unique. It was a bit exciting to not know what you were gonna get every time you clicked a student page. I think the website really does reflect how the program here works. You are encouraged to really do your own thing so the website becomes what you want it to become. I like that feeling of ownership and power. It breaks down some of the heirarchy by allowing equal access to both students and faculty. The site is intimidating at first but I think the more I have lived with it and explored it, it has become one of my favorites.  </p>
