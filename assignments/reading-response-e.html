      "Many of the issues we dealt with were connected to the text and my decision to list the names chronologically. People felt it would be an inconvenience to have to search out a
      name in a book and then find its panel location and thought that an alphabetical listing would be more
      convenient—until a tally of how many Smiths had died made it clear that an alphabetical listing wouldn’t
      be feasible. The MIA groups wanted their list of the missing separated out and listed alphabetically. I knew
      this would break the strength of the time line, interrupting the real-time experience of the piece, so I fought
      hard to maintain the chronological listing. I ended up convincing the groups that the time in which an
      individual was noted as missing was the emotionally compelling time for family members."

        I like how she talked about the struggle of getting your vision approved. We recently met with Irma Boom and she spoke a lot about how she has to fight for her ideas.
        She has to adopt a very stubborn and resolute stance when trying to see her vision carried out. I always wonder how much I should be firm in what I want but also allow
        space for compromise. I think if what you want to execute is central to the idea, it is important to fight for it. Especially if your concept is strong it is easier to defend your decision making.
